# Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Smart Contract

A comprehensive DAO implementation built with Clarity that enables decentralized governance through token staking, proposal creation, and voting mechanisms.

## Features

- **Secure Member Management**: Token staking/unstaking with proper access controls
- **Proposal Lifecycle**: Create, vote, and execute proposals
- **Voting System**: Weighted voting based on staked tokens
- **Treasury Management**: Secure handling of proposal fund distribution
- **Configurable Parameters**: Adjustable quorum, proposal duration, and minimum proposal amounts

## Quick Start

```bash
# Check contract syntax
clarinet check

# Run tests

```

## Architecture

The DAO contract consists of several core components:

1. **Member Management**

   - Token staking/unstaking
   - Voting power calculation
   - Member status tracking

2. **Proposal System**

   - Proposal creation with title, description, amount
   - Voting period management
   - Execution/rejection logic

3. **Voting Mechanism**

   - Weighted voting based on staked tokens
   - Vote validation and recording
   - Quorum tracking

4. **Security**
   - Role-based access control
   - Input validation
   - Safe state transitions

## Contract Interface

See [Technical Specification](docs/technical-specification.md) for detailed API documentation.

## Security Considerations

- All state changes require proper authorization
- Input validation on all public functions
- Protected treasury operations
- Atomic state updates
- Proper error handling
